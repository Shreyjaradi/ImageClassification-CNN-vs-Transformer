# Comparative Analysis of CNN and Transformer Architectures for Image Classification


## Project Overview

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures for image classification. Our team will collaborate to build, train, and evaluate two distinct deep learning models: one based on a CNN and the other on a Transformer architecture, utilizing the same dataset. The primary goal is to gain insights into the differences between these architectures and to determine scenarios suitable for each.
